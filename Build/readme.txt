This folder contains files needed to generate the various NetImgui projects.

User can safely ignore its content; only "GenerateProject.bat" needs calling.

Optionally, "GenerateCompatibilityTest.bat" can be called to get older versions of Dear ImGui and test compatibility of NetImgui against all of them.
